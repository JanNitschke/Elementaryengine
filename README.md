# Elementaryengine
Elementaryengine is a super light weight yet high performance game engine made for fully dynamic worlds containing many copy's of a limited amount of meshes. Physics are handled using the Bullet3 Physics library.
It supports Javascript and can load scripts dynamically using Cakra Core by Microsoft. This engine is still pre-alpha and has a long way to go.
The main features missing at the moment are networking, animations and open world support. 
Other features may be incomplete. Advanced features like AI or custom shaders will never be part of this Engine. Which doesn't mean its impossible to do, but you will have to add those features yourself. This is part of keeping the engine bloat free, which also is why I don't plan to add a GUI and leveldesigner at the moment.
## I do not recommend using this engine right now. Its far from finished and will never be as user friendly as unity, cryengine or unreal. I only recommend using it when your needs are out of reach for those engines and you want something very customizable.
Another goal for this engine is to be friendly to people that are not experienced in c++ and graphics APIs. That's why it uses JavaScript as an interface to be reachable for many people. You can still code in c++ of course
