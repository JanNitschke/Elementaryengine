# Elementaryengine
Elementaryengine is a super light weight yet high performance game engine made for fully dynamic worlds containing many copys of a limited amount of meshs. Physics are handled using the Bullet3 Physics library.
It supports Javascript and can load scripts dynamicly using Cakra Core by Microsoft. This engine is stil pre-alpha and has a long way to go.
The main fetures missing at the moment are networking, animations and open world support. 
Other features may be incomplete. Advenced features like AI or custom shaders will never be part of this Engine. Wich doesn't mean its impossible to do, but you will have to add those features yourself. This is part of keeping the engine bloat free, wich also is why I dont plan to add a GUI and leveldesigner at the moment.
## I do not recommend using this engine right now. Its far from finished and will never be as user friendly as unity, cryengine or unreal. I only recommend using it when your needs are out of reach for those engines and you want something very customisable.
